## General Information
- This project solves the problem of manual order cancellation handling by using an AI Agent to validate business logic and process requests.
- The purpose is to demonstrate a Stateful AI Agent capable of understanding natural language, querying databases, and pausing for human approval.
- It bridges the gap between autonomous AI and human oversight (Human-in-the-loop).

## Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Python 3.10+, FastAPI, LangGraph, LangChain, Llama 3.1 (Groq).
- **Frontend**: React.js, CSS, Axios.
- **Database**: SQLite.
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Render, Vercel

## Features
- **Intent Recognition**: Extracts Order IDs and user intentions (cancel, confirm, deny) using Pydantic structured outputs.
- **Business Guardrails**: Automatically rejects cancellation for orders already "Delivered" or "Cancelled".
- **Human-in-the-loop**: High-risk actions (like cancelling a pending order) are held in a queue for Admin approval.
- **Persistent Memory**: Remembers conversation context using LangGraph's state management.

## Frontend Overview
The system features a React-based web interface divided into two main functional areas:

### 1. Customer Chat Page
- **Purpose**: Provides a conversational interface for customers to interact with the AI Agent.
- **Main Tasks**: Users can ask about order status or request cancellations using natural language.

### 2. Admin Dashboard
- **Purpose**: Acts as the "Human-in-the-loop" control center.
- **Main Tasks**: Monitors all pending cancellation requests generated by the AI and provides Approve/Reject actions.

## Setup
### Backend
1. Navigate to the `/backend` folder.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Create a `.env` file: `MY_SECRET_KEY=your_groq_api_key`.
4. Run: `uvicorn main:app --reload`.

### Frontend
1. Navigate to the `/frontend` folder.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run: `npm start`

### Docker Deployment
```bash
docker build -t ai-order-agent .
docker run -p 8000:8000 --env-file .env ai-order-agent 
```
## Usage
* **Customer**: "I want to cancel my order ABC."
* **AI Agent**: Checks DB -> Validates status -> Submits request to Admin -> Replies: "Request sent for approval."
* **Admin**: Logs into Dashboard -> Clicks **Approve**.

## Project Status
Project is: **Complete** - Fully functional with Backend and Frontend integration.

## Room for Improvement
- Add Email/Telegram notifications for Admin approvals.
- Migration to PostgreSQL for production-grade data persistence.
